I" <p>No, a lot of things that I do is reading the hieroglyphs on liquid crystal displays. (Your screen) Like you‚Äôre doing right now, reading this post on  your smartphone or computer.</p>

<p>Most of the time if I want to accomplish things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>I read the manual that is included with almost every purchase.
Yes, I‚Äôve read the manual that was included with my new hoover.
<a href="https://www.philips.nl/c-p/FC9331_09R1/powerpro-compact-stofzuiger-zonder-stofzak-refurbished">Phillips PowerCyclone 5</a> I know what to do and how it works.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Press F1 for help, but I never use it. But it works in Google Chrome though. I write posts in Google Docs.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I use the search engine.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>You can literally ask your voice assistant? ‚ÄúHey Google, what‚Äôs the weather for today?‚Äù</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I think about it and come up with my own solutions.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>What about reading books? (Yes, I do read them, no, assuming I didn‚Äôt.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Are you reading the recipes or are you just throwing things in the Airfryer?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Like I said before, the majority of the time is spent reading, remembering and executing it.
Just like you watching Netflix with subtitles, because you can‚Äôt comprehend the spoken language. Why should I buy a physical book, when I need to read a lot on display(s) already? Also,I did buy a book physically.</p>
