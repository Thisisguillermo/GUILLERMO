Disclaimer: Well, this is how I do and perceive things, no hard feelings.
Edit: When I’m writing, I came to the conclusion it’s difficult for me to write things well and explain things, because a lot of things happen automatically outside my mind and I’m very sure some sentences are really weird.

## Intro

*Research and development (R&D) include activities that companies undertake to innovate and introduce new products and services. It is often the first stage in the development process. The goal is typically to take new products and services to market and add to the company's bottom line. * ~ Will Kenton

The same things apply to me, but I don’t introduce new products and services as in hardware like a car, dishwasher, notebook or anything else. R&D for me is staying ahead and being better than the “competition” in Technology, sports and more. Most frustrating part about R&D for me is that some people around me don’t get it.

## Frustrating about my R&D

R&D takes time and money, time is money and they aren’t infinite so I need to be as efficient as possible and take risks. Like Shotaro Kamiya, president of the Toyota Motor Sales Company said: *“There will be no progress if you fear failure.”*

As I’m doing my groceries right now and walking through aisles (sometimes for the second time) writing this post is actually very frustrating for me and pisses me off, because in my experience a lot of people don’t get it. And I have other things to do as I’m standing in a row in the supermarkt trying to get access to the self-checkout. But If you’re new to video game, you will probably need to follow a tutorial because you have no idea how things work inside the video game or probably going to guess how things are and getting your ass kicked by a 16 years old, because this person did actually read the manual, got through the tutorial or used the video sharing platform to stay ahead of his competition.

Judging the Game Developers Conference videos, a lot of people aren’t the brightest.
In my experience, things were tough when I needed to explain why I go to the gym. Obviously to improve my body to beat my competition. (whoever that may be) Good luck trying to wakeboard and execute some tricks only to be held back by your body. (This happened to me.)

More frustrating of my R&D is the part where I don’t get the specific information that I want, which means I need to research it and figure it out myself, despite the person having “experience” in the field.

So for example when I worked as an intern at several companies, my colleagues couldn’t handle basic questions and it’s frustrating, because they are basic. Examples are (from the top of my head):

“What’s the difference between Ubuntu, Debian and CentOS” (It’s more than only the package manager.)
Asking what devices support 802.11 AC
Differences between Windows, MacOS and Linux -versions (No, it’s not only visually)
Asking a designer which colour profile they are using in their raster graphic editor (Photoshop obviously) but has no clue about raster and vector and when to use vector graphics over raster.
Which NLE is being used, of course I’m talking about which video editor is being used. (Probably a good idea to Google this.)

These are the ones I can think of right now, but I’m sure things were way worse in real life. (0)

## Changing my approach and mentality.

I couldn’t get the information that I wanted or needed, because… they are hard to explain.

Like Ryan O’Neill said in his recent Tweet:

*Respectfully disagree. similar to the trap of saying you can “just tell” when someone is a senior engineer or not. There are very identifiable qualities that can be expressed about architecture and we should actively avoid operating on “feel” else we end up w very biased results*

So I changed my approach and mentality (Which I already did several years before, but things are sometimes incremental in my life. I keep updating myself.)

## My own way of Research and Development

Every question even if I could ask or just straight ask the performance) goes into the search engines search bar. This may be counter intuitive, but the results are way better.
Time spent on reading, analyzing, encapsulating and digesting takes time.

Like GitLab is mentioning in their “”Adopting a self-service and self-learning mentality” document:

*...as soon as an inquiry comes to mind. Rather, team members should redirect that effort to searching…*

They even have a guide to pave the way to make you less reliant on your colleagues.

https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/tools-and-tips/searching/
I wasn’t reliant on colleagues, but if people have way more years than I, my default way of asking a colleague was just impulsive.

## Keeping myself up-to-date

Again this takes time, because I don’t remember everything and there could be some errors when I’m explaining several things. Things may change over time, the interpretation wasn’t correct or something else. Most of the time I take the original source as truth, like for example I need to find information about Docker, I go to the official webpage of Docker and look for the documents. The following illustration will cover the things I have said earlier.

(0) Obviously I could Google this, some questions were part of an interview and people couldn't explain it. I didn’t get the job, but I probably dodged a bullet there. But I was genuinely interested, but couldn’t get the answer.
