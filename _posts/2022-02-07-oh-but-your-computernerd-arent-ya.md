No, a lot of things that I do is reading the hieroglyphs on liquid crystal displays. (Your screen) Like you’re doing right now, reading this post on  your smartphone or computer.

Most of the time if I want to accomplish things:

- I read the manual that is included with almost every purchase.
Yes, I’ve read the manual that was included with my new hoover.
[Phillips PowerCyclone 5](https://www.philips.nl/c-p/FC9331_09R1/powerpro-compact-stofzuiger-zonder-stofzak-refurbished) I know what to do and how it works.

- Press F1 for help, but I never use it. But it works in Google Chrome though. I write posts in Google Docs.

- I use the search engine.

- You can literally ask your voice assistant? “Hey Google, what’s the weather for today?”

- I think about it and come up with my own solutions.

- What about reading books? (Yes, I do read them, no, assuming I didn’t.)

- Are you reading the recipes or are you just throwing things in the Airfryer?

Like I said before, the majority of the time is spent reading, remembering and executing it.
Just like you watching Netflix with subtitles, because you can’t comprehend the spoken language. Why should I buy a physical book, when I need to read a lot on display(s) already? Also,I did buy a book physically.
